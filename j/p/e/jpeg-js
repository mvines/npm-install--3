jpeg-js\n\nA pure javascript JPEG encoder and decoder for node.js\n\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/eugeneware/jpeg-js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/eugeneware/jpeg-js)\n\n## Installation\n\nThis module is installed via npm:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install jpeg-js\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Decoding JPEGs\n\n``` js\nvar jpegData = fs.readFileSync('grumpycat.jpg');\nvar rawImageData = jpeg.decode(jpegData);\n```\n\n### Encoding JPEGs\n\n``` js\nvar width = 320, height = 180;\nvar frameData = new Buffer(width * height * 4);\nvar i = 0;\nwhile (i < frameData.length) {\n  frameData[i++] = 0xFF; // red\n  frameData[i++] = 0x00; // green\n  frameData[i++] = 0x00; // blue\n  frameData[i++] = 0xFF; // alpha - ignored in JPEGs\n}\nvar rawImageData = {\n  data: frameData,\n  width: width,\n  height: height\n};\nvar jpegImageData = jpeg.encode(rawImageData, 50);\n```\n\n## License\n\n### Decoding\n\nThis library builds on the work of two other JPEG javascript libraries,\nnamely [jpgjs](https://github.com/notmasteryet/jpgjs) for the decoding\nwhich is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License below:\n\nCopyright 2011 notmasteryet\n\nLicensed under the Apache

port to Javascript was done by by Andreas Ritter, www.bytestrom.eu, 11/2009.\n\nThe Adobe License for the encoder is:\n\n**Adobe**\n\nCopyright (c) 2008, Adobe Systems Incorporated\nAll rights
